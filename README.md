# PWA Test Sites Glitch Export

This is a brute force export of all of dmurph's glitch projects (whether relevant or not) and all sites from https://bit.ly/pwa-test-pages. The goal is to 'host' these somewhere more reliable. Currently github pages will work for all of the static sites that don't need node.js. Those sites will have to use something else TBD.

Many projects had to be 'remixed' by appending a '2' at the end so that the glitch download API would work. I have attempted to fix these directories, but I may have missed some.

I have also included a compressed version of the original download.
